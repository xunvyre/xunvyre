# Hi, I'm Victoria!
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! I'm a soon-to-be graduate of the UCF Full Stack Development boot camp,
so right now you'll find a lot of school projects and assignments in my portfolio. I'm planning on commenting these assignments out further
once the class is done to help future students get started on their own projects!

## Starred Projects
All of my projects have been sorted into lists to make thing easier to find! Click the "Stars" tab to get started.
