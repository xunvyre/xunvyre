# Hi, I'm Victoria!
Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile! I'm primarily a web designer with a focus on simple, informative, functional websites that are easy on the eyes and even easier to use. Right now I'm working on reformatting 
old school projects to align with the Digital Guinea Pig brand. When you have a new idea, you need a guinea pig!

* As a warning, all of my sites are optimized for Firefox because that is my personal preference, but I test them in a Chromium browser to ensure compatibility. Some things still may misalign for certain users!

## Starred Projects
All of my projects have been sorted into lists to make thing easier to find! Click the "Stars" tab to get started.
